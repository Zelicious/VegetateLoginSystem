# VegetateLoginSystem
Vegetate like the country. Implementing as many secure practices I can for a local login system. Login and store a secure message. Then log out. You can guarantee that your message will be safe. Note there is no password recovery here, so if you lose your password you will lose your message.

Using the system requires the python cryptography module

```
pip install crpytography
```
